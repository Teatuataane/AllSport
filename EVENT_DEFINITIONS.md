# AllSport Event Definitions
## Input Modes, Difficulty Tiers & Effort Tasks

> **Purpose:** This document is the authoritative spec for every event's input type, difficulty tiers, and effort task targets. It is the reference for the AI implementation that will update `lib/eventData.ts` and the scoring engine. Review and correct this before implementation begins.

---

## 1. New InputMode: `difficulty+reps`

A new InputMode must be added to the TypeScript union:

```ts
| 'difficulty+reps'  // Tier selector + rep count. Scored as: tierIndex × 10,000 + reps
```

Scoring formula mirrors `hold` (difficulty+time) but substitutes reps for seconds:
- Higher tier always beats lower tier
- Within the same tier, more reps wins
- `raw_score = tierIndex * 10000 + reps`  (tierIndex is 0-based)

**Special case — GHD Situp D4:** When the selected tier is D4 (GHD Situp), scoring switches to weight-based (like `strength` mode). `raw_score = weight_kg`. The weight input replaces the rep count input for D4 only.

---

## 2. InputMode Changes Summary

| Old Mode | New Mode | Affected Events |
|---|---|---|
| `dynamic` | `difficulty+time` | Flag, Planche, Back Lever, Iron Cross, Front Lever |
| `flexibility` | `difficulty+time` | Rear Hand Clasp, Forward Fold, Needle Pose, Middle Split, Shoulder Dislocate, Side Bend |
| `hold` (no tiers) → `difficulty+time` | Fix `hasDifficultyTiers: true` | Headstand, Bridge, Standing Split, Breakdancing |
| `reps` | `difficulty+reps` | 1 Leg Squat, Windshield Wipers, Chin Up Contest, Push Up Contest, Finger Push Up, Ab Wheel Rollout, Jump Rope, Juggling, Gymnastics |
| `difficulty+reps` | `difficulty+time` | Reverse Hyper (D2 renamed to Back Extension Hold) |
| `reps` | `strength` | Pause Dips, Pause Chin Up |
| `reps` | `difficulty+reps` (special D4) | Calf Raise → renamed GHD Situp |
| `reps` | `strength` | Leg Extension |
| `time` | `difficulty+time` | Rope Climb |
| `hold` | `distance` | Iron Lungs |
| No change | `strength` | Tib Curl (confirm: weight + reps, no tiers) |

---

## 3. Effort Task Patterns by InputMode

| Mode | Repeatable Effort Task |
|---|---|
| `strength` | 5 reps at 80% of PR weight |
| `difficulty+time` (non-D6) | Hold -1 tier for 2 min |
| `difficulty+time` (D6) | Complete half-distance at 80% pace (or same distance if D1) |
| `difficulty+reps` | One set at 80% of PR reps, same tier |
| `time` | Each effort at ≥80% of PR time |
| `sprint` | Each sprint within 80% of PR pace |
| `distance` | Each attempt ≥80% of PR distance |
| `sport` | Play a game vs a new opponent |
| `score` | Complete an additional 4 holes |

**Notes on `difficulty+time` effort tasks:**
- Effort tasks are generated from the decoded PR: `tierIdx = Math.floor(rawScore / 10000)`, `value = rawScore % 10000`.

**Notes on `difficulty+reps` effort tasks:**
- PR reps decoded from raw_score: `prReps = rawScore % 10000`, `prTierIdx = Math.floor(rawScore / 10000)`.
- Targets: `Math.round(prReps * 0.9)`, `* 0.8`, `* 0.7` — minimum 1 rep.

**Notes on `score` effort tasks:**
- Golf and Disc Golf use `score` mode. raw_score = -strokes (negative; fewer strokes = higher raw_score = better rank).
- Effort task: any additional 4-hole round after the first = +1 effort level.

---

## 4. `getBonusTargets` — Key Fix

The current condition gating effort tasks for hold+tier events is wrong:

```ts
// CURRENT (broken — misses domain 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 hold events)
const isFlexOrTieredHold =
  mode === 'flexibility' ||
  (event.hasDifficultyTiers && (event.domainNumber === 3 || event.domainNumber === 4))

// CORRECT
const isTieredHold = mode === 'difficulty+time' && event.hasDifficultyTiers
```

The function must also decode PR from `raw_score` (a number) — NOT from a "D5" string, since `get_player_season_pr` always returns a numeric `raw_score`.

---

## 5. Season PR Loading — Critical Note

`get_player_season_pr` always returns a numeric `raw_score`. For `difficulty+time` and `difficulty+reps` events, the tier is encoded in the number (`tierIdx * 10000 + value`). The effort task logic must decode this — do not expect a "D5" string.

The PR display line in the scoring UI (`PR: {seasonPR}`) must also decode and format these values correctly, e.g. "D3 · 45s" or "D2 · 12 reps".
